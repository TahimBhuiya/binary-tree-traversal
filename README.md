# Binary Tree Implementation in C++

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a **Binary Tree** in C++ with:
- In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order Traversals
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) with level tracking

The program builds a sample binary tree and demonstrates each algorithm.
